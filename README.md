## Key Insights

### 1. Churn by Contract Type
**Overview:**  
- Customers on **Month-to-Month** contracts have the highest churn rate. Long-term contract customers (One year and Two year contracts) are significantly less likely to churn.

### 2. Churn by Monthly Charges
**Overview:**  
- Customers with **higher monthly charges** (above \$70) have a higher likelihood of churning compared to those with lower monthly charges. This could be due to dissatisfaction with the perceived value of services relative to cost.


### 3. Churn by Tenure
**Overview:**  
- Customers with **short tenures** (0–12 months) show a significantly higher churn rate. Customers who stay beyond this period are much less likely to churn, showing that retention strategies during the first year are crucial.


### 4. Churn by Paperless Billing
**Overview:**  
- Customers who use **paperless billing** have a higher churn rate than those who don’t. This could be linked to a lack of engagement with billing statements or customers feeling less connected to their bills.


### 5. Churn Summary
**Overview:**  
- Customers who churn have **higher average monthly charges** (\$74.44 vs. \$61.26), shorter tenures (18 months vs. 38 months), and lower total charges (\$1531 vs. \$2555). These metrics show that churn is concentrated among newer, high-paying customers.

## Business Recommendations

Based on the findings from the analysis, the following strategies are recommended to reduce churn and improve customer retention:

### 1. Promote Long-Term Contracts
Create marketing campaigns and offers that encourage customers to move away from month-to-month plans. Offering discounts for committing to a longer-term contract can reduce churn and increase customer loyalty.

### 2. Address Customer Concerns Related to High Monthly Charges
Review the services provided to high-paying customers. Consider offering additional value through personalized service, loyalty programs, or periodic discounts. High-spending customers should feel they are getting value for their money.

### 3. Target Early Tenure Customers
Implement retention initiatives during the first 12 months. For example, personalized follow-ups, exclusive discounts, or enhanced support during this period can make new customers feel valued, increasing the likelihood of them staying.

### 4. Improve Engagement with Paperless Billing Users
Enhance communication with customers using paperless billing by providing clear, engaging, and timely billing information. Regular email reminders or digital notifications could improve customer engagement and reduce churn among this group.

### 5. Focus on High-Value Customers
Since high-value customers (those with high monthly charges) tend to churn more, offering tailored services and ensuring that these customers feel appreciated could significantly improve retention. A dedicated customer success team could help identify potential churn risks early and take action.
